          <p>
            Project-based trainees can either join for a period of six months or

            suitable project based on their interest. Feel free to reach out to
            our current Project trainees listed under the Team page to find out
            about their experience.

        <h4>Guest workers-</h4>
        <p>
          This is an unpaid position that is generally suited for students
          looking for a quick pitstop en route to grad school or looking to
          spend their summers more productively. This is also suited for
          students trained in a particular field but are interested in switching
          gears to Neuroscience/Genomics and would like to gain some research
          experience in a Neuroscience research lab. The minimum duration is 2
          months and the maximum is three months. No accommodation will be
          provided at CCMB. Guest workers will not get access to the Animal/Cell
          culture facility and will primarily observe lab members performing
          these experiments. They will however be trained in Molecular Biology
          techniques, preparation of next-gen sequencing libraries, participate
          in lab meetings and journal clubs, and gain an overall experience of
          what it is like to work in a research lab. Feel free to reach out to
          our current Guest workers listed under the Team page to find out about
          their experience.
